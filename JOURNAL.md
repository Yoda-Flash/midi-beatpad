# June 2nd: Research
- Looked at different designs for midi controllers with a 16 pad beatpad and 2 octave keyboard
- Found the [Alexis V125](https://www.alesis.com/products/view2/vi25) ![Alexis V125 Image](https://www.alesis.com/images/uploads/product-overview-images/VI25_Overview_1.png)
- Researched the functions of different buttons on a MIDI controller --> turns out they are all assignable
- Decided to use an RPi Pico for a custom PCB
- Researched ways to do velocity and pressure sensing
    - Will likely use 2 buttons or IR sensors and measure the time difference to calculate velocity
- Thought about ways to make the design modular 
    - Will likely use a magnet

**Total time spent: ~3.5 hours**
